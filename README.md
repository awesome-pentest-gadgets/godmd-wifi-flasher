# godmd-wifi-flasher

A flasher tool written in java, that does over the air flashing of esp-link based ESP devices as used in the goDMD http://go-dmd.de/

Uses the same mechanism like esp-link wiflash cmdline utility, but has a swing / java UI.

The two version of a firmware (user1.bin and user2.bin) must be contained in a zip archive, that is then selected by the tool.
